 <h2>According to me, of course</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>1. 2001: A Space Odyssey</h3>
 <p>A great Sci-Fi movie about about the development of the human society, and regardless of how much it seems to change, its nature always appears to stay the same way.</p>
 <h3>2. Dune (Part 1 and 2)</h3>
 <p>Adapted from Herbert's books, the movies show how a authority figure given divine status is dangerous in its nature. </p>
 <h3>3. Shining</h3>
 <p>Another Kubrick masterpiece.</p>
